Problem 5 on the midterm had a rotation matrix for imaginary angles, so the answer was none of the above

There will likely be another midterm after spring break

e^ix = cos(x) + i * sin(x), where i^2 = -1
Derived from this, e^(pi * i) = -1

Euler angle rotations
  Z-axis global - precession
  X-axis local - nutation
  Z-axis local - spin
