# Direction Cosines and Kinematics

Next week there will be a midterm which will be difficult

It will cover

* Direction cosines
* Euler angles
* No quaternions

We will soon be learning forward and reverse kinematics

DH parameters are four parameters to the DH method

Directional cosines

v = ai + aj + ak
vi = aii = a
a = vi

If we construct a matrix, 3x3, and have each column have I, J, K and each
row we have i, j, k and ones overlapping are dot products we can construct
an equation. This matrix is R.

`R * [i j k]' = [I J K]'`

I, J, and K are global unit vectors, and i, j, and k are local unit vectors

R in the above equations is matrix transformation from the local frame to the
global frame.

The direction cosines matrix is the elementwise cosine of R

Octave has \ for solving systems of equations, but only linear ones. Wolfram
Alpha will solve equations with exponents involved.

The dot product is commutative

Exercise #11 on the slides is similar to what will be on the exam

The final orientation of a body after rotations is equivalent to a unique
rotation around a unique axis

The *Orientation Kinematics Problem* is the determination of the rotation angle
phi of a rigid body with a point O around a fixed axis v

The `Tr` function is the sum of the diagonal of a matrix

Euler-Rodrigues form may also be on the exam

Midterm content ends with Exercise #21 on the slides

"Quaternions are powerful but clumsy"

Quaternions are not as convenient as vectors, but they are more
performance-friendly
